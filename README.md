# DeepPicar

DeepPicar is a low-cost autonomous RC car platform using a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). DeepPicar is a small scale replication
of [NVIDIA's real self-driving car called DAVE-2](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which drove on public
roads using a CNN. DeepPicar uses the same CNN architecture of NVIDIA's
DAVE-2 and can drive itself in real-time locally on a Raspberry Pi.

## Setup

Install DeepPicar (Modified).

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/LogEman/Logan-DeepPi-Car
    $ cd Logan-DeepPi-Car
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
    $ sudo apt install libopenblas0
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
    $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    

Edit `params.py` to select correct camera and actuator drivers. 
The setting below represents the standard webcam and drv8835 configuration, for example. 

    camera="camera-webcam"
    actuator="actuator-drv8835"
    
In addition, you need to setup the necessary python drivers. For polulu drv8835, do following.

    $ cd drv8835-motor-driver-rpi
    $ sudo python3 setup.py install

Also install the python package "inputs" if you would like to to use Logitech F710 gamepad for data collection.

    $ cd inputs
    $ sudo pip3 install .
    
## Manual control and Data collection

To start the backend server

    $ sudo nice --20 python deeppicar.py -n 4 -f 30 -g

Keyboard controls  
A: move forward   
Z: move backward  
S: stop  
J: turn left  
K: center  
L: turn right   
R: start/stop recording  
D: turn on DNN  

Use the keys to manually control the car. Once you become confident in controlling the car, collect the data to be used for training the DNN model. 

The data collection can be enabled and stopped by pressing `R`. Once recording is enabled, the video feed and the corresponding control inputs are stored in `out-video.avi` and `out-key.csv` files, respectively. Later, we will use these files for training. It can be downloaded using scp commands.

Each recording attempt with overwrite the previous

Compress all the recorded files into a single zip file, say Dataset.zip for Colab.

    $ zip Dataset.zip out-*
    updating: out-key.csv (deflated 81%)
    updating: out-video.avi (deflated 3%)

## Train the model
    
Open the colab notebook. Following the notebook, you will upload the dataset to the colab, train the model, and download the model back to your PC. 

[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14yYePpWXmfmk9iFqHvRVr1YAbTDJXzHw?usp=sharing)

After you are done trainig, you need to copy the trained tflite model file (`large-200x66x3.tflite` by default) to the Pi using scp commands.

## Autonomous control

Copy the trained model to the DeepPicar. 

Enable autonomous driving by pressing A to go foward then D.
